    * Summary Statistic Table worksheet contains to both table for Sucessful and failed data. 
    * Successfull results are within Column A and B
    * Failed results are within Column F and G.

    * Based on the graphs for success campaign median summarises the data more more meaningfully than mean. For failed campain mean summarizes the data more meaningfully.

    * There is more variability with successful campaigns based on the variance.
    
     . Does this make sense?  Yes
     
        Why or why not? 
        
        Standard Deviation + Mean for succssful = 1039 
        Standard Deviation + Mean for failed = 79
        
        Therefore more variability is with successful campaigns.
